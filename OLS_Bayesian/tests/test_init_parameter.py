purpose of this test:
- test the initialization of the InitParameter class
- test the dimension of distribution 
- test if we have the mean and covariance matrix as input
- test if the output is a vector of the correct dimension
- test if the output is a sample from the multivariate normal distribution with the given mean and covariance
- test if the output is a sample from the multivariate normal distribution with the default mean and covariance
- test if the output is a sample from the multivariate normal distribution with a given covariance
- test if the output is a sample from the multivariate normal distribution with a given mean
- test if the output is a sample from the multivariate normal distribution with a given mean and covariance
- test if the output is a sample from the multivariate normal distribution with a given mean and a default covariance
- test if the output is a sample from the multivariate normal distribution with a default mean and a given covariance
